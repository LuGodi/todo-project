How should I add the edit ? As a modal? As a dialog?
Todo: fix close activating submit on dialogs - done
Todo: Submit button on edition must submit and render the changes - done
Bug: Adding todo to a new form will disable the default project field on the next todo -fixed
Todo:Implement project deletion - done
Visual Bug:rendering more projects than 3 will cause disalignment issues
Bug:Two default projects fixed

Refactoring: Better event listeners for forms and edition
On edition this prob can be done through stop propagation

refactoring: formdata handling the lack of projects
